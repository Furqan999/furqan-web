</div>

<div style="position:relative;">
  <div style="color:#ddd;background-color:white;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
  <h3 style=" color: black;">We’ve been creating exceptional websites since the early dot com era. Here’s our story.</h3>
  <p style="color: black;">
    What started as a mutually beneficial business relationship between our co-founders Evan Bayly and Aaron Main, quickly turned into the partnership that holds Expert together to this day. Expert was originally established back in 1998 when Google was still based out of Susan Wojcicki’s garage, and a dollar could still get you a litre of petrol.

Twenty years on and hundreds of websites later, we’re proud to say Expert is one of New Zealand’s longest running, most reliable web development and design companies around.

Check out our timeline below to see the highlights of our time creating exceptional work. </p>

   
<h3 style=" color: black;">Our Timeline.</h3>
<p style="color: black;">
It all began with our two owners, Evan Bayly and Aaron Main. Aaron was working in an IT department of a large organization while also running his own web development business on the side. Evan was busy sharing his marketing knowledge as a Business Advisor and Consultant. When Aaron began to build websites for Evan’s clients the two quickly realised how their talents complimented one another.
